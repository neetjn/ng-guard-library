# Guard

Guard was a licensing system I wrote late highschool, early college to help manage subscriptions for my online gaming community. This project is the source code for the client library to interact with the Guard api for fetching Guard and forum (xenforo) specific profile data. It was created using .NET 4.5 (or so I believe), and was of course designed specifically for Windows host machines.

This is an attrocity I wrote before having proper programming etiquette, enjoy.
